#### Prepare Excel data for efficient analysis in PowerBi.

## Summary

In Tthis task  we were asked to use different ways to organize and calculate  the data .

The goal was to create a summary showing how a business's profits changed month by

month in Quarter 1 compared to the same time last year.

I needed to make the report easy to read by changing how it looks and

highlighting important results. I also had to use formulas to:

**Create specific totals for each month in Quarter 1 for two different business years using the SUMIF function.**

**Figure out the percentage difference for each month in Quarter 1 of 2023 compared to the same months in 2022.**

**Use a logical function to test the order value and display the correct tax amount.**

## PREPARE DATA

I started by downloading and opening the Microsoft Excel workbook "Quarter One Report.xlsx,"

Containing a single worksheet labeled "Summary." This sheet displayed sales information for specific 

Products over two years, including wholesale and retail prices as well as sales quantities.

Next, I checked for missing and duplicate values in the data.

Following that, I organized and adjusted the headings in the Excel sheet. 

Initially, I inserted the heading "TOTAL Q1 SALES" into cell A4. Then, 

I labeled cell A10 as "Q1 MONTHLY TOTALS." Once the headings were in place,

I applied various formatting options To ensure they were visually impactful

The words in the "Product Category" column were all written in capital letters.

We wanted to change them. So, I made a formula using the PROPER function.

This formula makes all the letters lowercase and capitalizes the first letter of each word.

*The formula's syntax is:* 

**=PROPER(G2)**. Upon application, the content in cell "Product Category"  transformed into *"Mountain Bikes"*

## PROSSES DATA 

Create new columns for month and year, I crafted a formula in cell K2 using the **MONTH** function,

And another in cell L2 using the **YEAR** function. These formulas extracted the respective components from 

The  "Order Date" column .  

*The syntax for the formula in K2 was*

**"=MONTH(J2)"** 

*The syntax for the formula in L2 was*

**"=YEAR(J2)"**

I create a new column called "Total (Before Task)" using a basic multiplication

Formula that multiplied the retail price by the order quantity.

*The syntax for the formula in P2 was*

**"=N2*O2"**

I utilized the IF function to calculate tax and placed it in a new column named "Tax Due" located in cell Q2.

The IF function had to check if the amount in "Total(Befor Tax)" column was over 2000. If it was, then the amount in 

 Total(Befor Tax) column  Had to be multiplied by 5%. If it was not, then column  "Tax Due" should display a 0.

*The syntax for the formula in Tasx Due was*

**"=IF(P2>2000,P2*5%,0)"**

 **For TOTAL Q1 SALES**
 
In cell B6, I created a SUMIF formula to sum the sales values for 2022. The sales values were in the 

"Order Total" column. The criteria  was in "Year"column.Then I created a similar formula in 

Cell C6 with the same cell ranges but changed the criteria to 2023. 

*The syntax for the formula in B6 was:*

**"=SUMIF(L2:L246,2022,R2:R246)"**

*The syntax for the formula in C6 was:*

**"=SUMIF(L2:L246,2023,R2:R246)"**

**FOR Q1 MONTHLY TOTAL**

*YEAR 2022*

I created a SUMIFS formula to calculate the total for January in cell B12, February in cell B13, and March in cell B14. 
 
I added dollar signs to the R and K cell references so that the formula could be copied down.
 
*The syntax for the formula in B12 was:* 

**"=SUMIFS($R2:$R246,$L2:$L246,"2022",K2:K246,1)"**

*The syntax for the formula in B13 was:*

**"=SUMIFS($R2:$R246,$L2:$L246,"2022",K2:K246,2)"**

*The syntax for the formula in B14 was:*

**"=SUMIFS($R2:$R246,$L2:$L246,"2022",K2:K246,3)"**

*YEAR 2023*

I did the same steps above  for the year 2023 in the cells C12, C13 ,AND C14.

*The syntax for the formula in C12 was:* 

**"=SUMIFS($R2:$R246,$L2:$L246,"2023",K2:K246,1)"**

*The syntax for the formula in C13 was:*

**"=SUMIFS($R2:$R246,$L2:$L246,"2023",K2:K246,2)"**

*The syntax for the formula in C14 was:*

**"=SUMIFS($R2:$R246,$L2:$L246,"2023",K2:K246,3)"**

![Screenshot (181)](https://github.com/nisrinfrh/nisrinfrh.github.io./assets/157531427/b87f0fd0-a445-4641-b479-26d41fb473e6)

I created a Percentage difference formula in D6 which showed the percentage by which sales increased in 2023.

To determine the percentage difference between the results for 2022 and 2023, the total for 2022 first had to 

be subtracted from the 2023 total. The result had then to be divided by the result for 2022. 

*The syntax for the formula in D6 was:*
 
**"=(C6-B6)/B6"**

I created a similar formula in D12 and copied the calculation in D12 down to D14. 

**"=(C12-B12)/B12"**
**"=(C13-B13)/B1"**
**"=(C14-B14)/B14"**

### Conclusionâ€¯

In this scenario, my primary objective was to prepare data by employing essential Excel formulas

And functions, while also utilizing diverse formatting techniques. I created various formulas to

Generate data columns in a spreadsheet, aiming to calculate customized totals and transform 

Standard sales data into a concise summary, ready to be efficiently analyzed in PowerBI. 

This prepared data will assist in making well-informed business decisions.
