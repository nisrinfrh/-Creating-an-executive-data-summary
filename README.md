## Summary

In Tthis task  we were asked to use different ways to organize and calculate  the data .

The goal was to create a summary showing how a business's profits changed month by

month in Quarter 1 compared to the same time last year.

I needed to make the report easy to read by changing how it looks and

highlighting important results. I also had to use formulas to:

**Create specific totals for each month in Quarter 1 for two different business years using the SUMIF function.**

**Figure out the percentage difference for each month in Quarter 1 of 2023 compared to the same months in 2022.**

**Use a logical function to test the order value and display the correct tax amount.**
