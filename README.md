## Summary

In Tthis task  we were asked to use different ways to organize and calculate  the data .

The goal was to create a summary showing how a business's profits changed month by

month in Quarter 1 compared to the same time last year.

I needed to make the report easy to read by changing how it looks and

highlighting important results. I also had to use formulas to:

**Create specific totals for each month in Quarter 1 for two different business years using the SUMIF function.**

**Figure out the percentage difference for each month in Quarter 1 of 2023 compared to the same months in 2022.**

**Use a logical function to test the order value and display the correct tax amount.**

## PREPARE DATA

I started by downloading and opening the Microsoft Excel workbook "Quarter One Report.xlsx,"

Containing a single worksheet labeled "Summary." This sheet displayed sales information for specific 

Products over two years, including wholesale and retail prices as well as sales quantities.

Afterward, I adjusted and organized the headings in the Excel sheet. Initially, I selected cell

A4 and inputted the heading "TOTAL Q1 SALES." Then, I chose cell A10 and typed "Q1 MONTHLY TOTALS" as

The heading. Once the headings were added to cells A4 and A10, I applied various formatting options 

To ensure they were visually impactful.

The entries  in column G was originally in all capital letters, but we needed to change it. 

I devised a formula utilizing the PROPER function, which adjusts text case.

This formula formats text into lowercase while capitalizing the first letter of each word.

The formula's syntax is: 

**=PROPER(G2)**. Upon application, the content in cell H2 transformed into *"Mountain Bikes"*
